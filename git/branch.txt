# Scenario based on source: https://realpython.com/deploying-a-django-app-to-aws-elastic-beanstalk/

$ git clone https://github.com/realpython/image-of-the-day.git
$ cd image-of-the-day/
$ git checkout tags/start_here

[israel@w50019045l-mutworld-be image-of-the-day]$ git checkout tags/start_here
Note: checking out 'tags/start_here'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:

  git checkout -b <new-branch-name>

# Note that you can move from dettached to attached to HEAD by creating a branch.

You can check your current state as follows:

[israel@w50019045l-mutworld-be image-of-the-day]$ git branch
* (HEAD detached at start_here)
  master

# Create a new branch and switch to use it:

[israel@w50019045l-mutworld-be image-of-the-day]$ git branch test
[israel@w50019045l-mutworld-be image-of-the-day]$ git branch
* (HEAD detached at start_here)
  master
  test
[israel@w50019045l-mutworld-be image-of-the-day]$ git checkout test 
Switched to branch 'test'
[israel@w50019045l-mutworld-be image-of-the-day]$ git branch
  master
* test


At this point, commits can be made on the new branch to implement the new feature. Once the feature is complete, the branch 
can be merged back into the main code branch (usually master).

First we run git checkout master to change the active branch back to master. Then we run the command git merge new-branch 
to merge the new feature into the master branch.

# ...develop some code...

$ git add –A
$ git commit –m "Some commit message"
$ git checkout master
Switched to branch 'master'
$ git merge test

#### REBASE AND/OR MERGE

#### rebase from master to branch, or using merge

REBASE:

Taking the example from the git rebase manual, git rebase master in branch feature:

      A---B---C feature                             A'--B'--C' feature
     /                   --rebase-->               /
D---E---F---G master                  D---E---F---G master

However, git rebase is only suitable when the branch hasn't been distributed, or there will be confusion and extra work 
downstream, because the old commits A, B, C are now replaced by new commits A', B', C', plus F and G that were not there before.

The actual result after git rebase master in branch feature is this:

      ( A---B---C )
       /
      /       A'--B'--C' feature
     /       /
D---E---F---G master

Commits A, B, C are dangling after the rebase, but are reachable through git reflog feature.

MERGE:

If someone has pulled your branch, or you have pushed it somewhere, you should merge into it instead, to avoid 
confusion and extra work on the other end. See Recovering from upstream rebase.

This is the result of git merge master in branch feature:

      A---B---C feature                    A---B---C---M feature
     /                   --merge-->       /       ,---’
D---E---F---G master                 D---E---F---G master

Alternatively, if you git merge feature in branch master, it would look like this:

      A---B---C feature                    A---B---C feature
     /                   --merge-->       /         \
D---E---F---G master                 D---E---F---G---M master
