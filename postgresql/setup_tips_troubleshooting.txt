# after installing you must init database:

$ sudo /usr/pgsql-11/bin/postgresql-11-setup initdb
Initializing database ... OK

# Setup postgres password:

$ sudo su - postgres 
[postgres@fed29 ~]$ psql -c "alter user postgres with password 'StrongPassword'" 
ALTER ROLE

In case you want to use password, it is important to update following file with md5 option instead of ident:

# METHOD can be "trust", "reject", "md5", "password", "scram-sha-256",
# Note that "password" sends passwords in clear text; "md5" or
host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            md5
host    all             all             ::1/128                 md5
host    replication     all             127.0.0.1/32            md5

# You can use pgadmin for managing the postgres databases
